# 🚀 AI Software Development Agent

A comprehensive AI-powered application that assists with frontend development, backend API generation, and DSA problem-solving, built with security as a priority.

## 🌟 Features

### 🌐 Frontend Development
- Generate complete HTML/CSS/JS code for various website types
- Live preview of generated websites
- Secure HTML sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

### 🔧 Backend Development
- Generate API code based on natural language descriptions
- Automatic validation of code for security vulnerabilities
- Instant API deployment with interactive documentation
- Test your APIs directly from the application interface

### 📊 DSA Problem Solving
- Solve complex data structure and algorithm problems
- Generate optimized solutions with explanations
- Secure code execution with proper sandboxing and timeouts

### 🔒 Security Features
- Static code analysis to detect potentially harmful code
- Secure file operations using atomic writes
- API key encryption for secure storage
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, code injection)
- Resource limitation to prevent DoS attacks
- Safe HTML rendering with content sanitization

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An API key for Google's Gemini AI service

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShawneilRodrigues/Software-Engineer-Agent.git
cd Software-Engineer-Agent
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file:
```
APP_SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

This application implements several layers of security:

1. **Code Validation**: All generated code undergoes static analysis to detect potential security threats before execution.

2. **Secure Execution Environment**: Code is executed in a controlled environment with timeouts and resource limitations.

3. **API Key Management**: Your API keys are encrypted before being stored in the session state.

4. **HTML Sanitization**: Generated HTML is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

5. **Secure File Operations**: All file operations use atomic writes to prevent race conditions and file corruption.

## 🚢 Containerization (Optional)

The application can be containerized using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t software-engineer-agent .
docker run -p 8501:8501 software-engineer-agent
```

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Enter your Gemini API key in the sidebar
2. Select the task you want to perform
3. Enter your requirements or problem statement
4. Generate and interact with the results
5. For backend APIs, you can directly test the deployed API

## 🔍 Backend API Testing

When you generate a backend API:
1. The API automatically starts on an available port
2. You'll receive links to interact with your API
3. The Swagger UI (for FastAPI) is embedded directly in the interface
4. You can test endpoints without leaving the application
